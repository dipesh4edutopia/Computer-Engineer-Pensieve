<node TEXT="A technical book about popular space-efficient data structures and fast algorithms that are extremely useful in modern Big Data applications. Probabilistic data structures is a common name for data structures based mostly on different hashing techniques. Unlike regular (or deterministic) data structures they always provide approximated answers but with reliable ways to estimate possible errors."
