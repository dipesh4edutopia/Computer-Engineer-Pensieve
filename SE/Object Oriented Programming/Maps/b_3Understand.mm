<node TEXT="C++ Operator Overloading Guidelines. One of the nice features of C++ is that you can give special meanings to operators when they are used with user-defined classes. This is called operator overloading. You can implement C++ operator overloads by providing special member-functions on your classes that follow a particular naming convention."
