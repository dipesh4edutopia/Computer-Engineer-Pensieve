			<node ID="ID_719177763" TEXT="How do I prove merge works using mathematical induction? Ask Question Asked 4 years 9 months ago.  but the merge algorithm on my homework isnt the actual one and works in a different way. Instead of L and R would the answer be they are within the range of [1k] because the tail of an array is merged with the other array for each iteration? " />

			<node ID="ID_856420920" TEXT="And if we apply the three-way merge algorithm to X#5 Y#5 and Z#2 we see that this is in fact exactly what we do get. [Animation: click to see the result of a merge using X#5 as the base.] Note that Z#1s content is the same as X#5s. Thats because Z was branched from X#5. So Z#1 is just as good a base as X#5." />

			<node ID="ID_243346560" TEXT="Polyphase Sort/Merge. The Polyphase sort/merge algorithm is again an improvement to the other algorithms described. This algorithms works just like the Balanced k-Way Sort/Merge algorithm but it does not use as many files. The algorithm simply make use of the empty input file by turning that file into the output file." />
