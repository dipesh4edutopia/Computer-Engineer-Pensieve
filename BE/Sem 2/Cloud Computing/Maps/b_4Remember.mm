However it is still a challenge to achieve energy savings based on QoS during task scheduling. In this paper a QoS-based energy-aware task scheduling method named QET in cloud environment is proposed to address the above " />

As a first step toward enabling energy efficient consolidation we study the inter-relationships between energy consumption resource utilization and performance of consolidated workloads. The study reveals the energy performance trade-offs for consolidation and shows that " />
