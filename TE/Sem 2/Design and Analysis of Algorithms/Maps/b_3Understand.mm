Rabin () that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It uses a rolling hash to quickly filter out positions of the text that cannot match the pattern and then checks for a match at the remaining positions." />

			<node ID="ID_487306819" TEXT="Like the Naive Algorithm Rabin-Karp algorithm also slides the pattern one by one. But unlike the Naive algorithm Rabin Karp algorithm matches the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of current substring of text and if the hash values match then only it starts matching individual characters." />

			<node ID="ID_283929506" TEXT="The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find patterns in strings. A string is an abstract data type that consists of a sequence of characters. Letters words sentences and more can be represented as strings. String matching is a very important application of computer science." />
